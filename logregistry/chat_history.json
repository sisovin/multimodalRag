These droplets act as prisms, refracting (or bending) light and separating it into its individual colors.\n2. **Sunlight passes through water droplets**: After the rain stops, the sun's rays pass through these water droplets at a precise angle, which is around 42 degrees. This angle allows the light to be refracted, or bent, and split into its individual colors.\n3. **Refraction and dispersion**: As sunlight enters the water droplet, it is refracted, or bent, and split into its individual colors due to the different wavelengths of light being refracted at slightly different angles. This process is known as dispersion.\n4. **Colors spread out**: The separated colors are then reflected off the back of the water droplet and exit the droplet at a wider angle. As a result, the colors spread out and form an arc shape in the sky, creating the beautiful spectrum we see as a rainbow.\n\nSo, to summarize: after the rain stops, the sun's rays pass through tiny water droplets in the air, which refract and disperse the light into its individual colors, forming the stunning display of a rainbow."}, {"role": "user", "Content": "As based on this formular of (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, then supposed what is the result of x with the equation like 59x + 81 = 8 + 25x, resolve with this detail explanation.

Of course, in purchasing power one bill is just like any other, but the friends are clearly distinguishable from one another.

For example, if you have 3 dollar bills and 2 friends, one possible arrangement could be: $$\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_$ $\\_\\_$, where the first friend has 0 dollars, the second friend has 0 dollars, and the third friend has 1 dollar.\n\nNow, consider all possible arrangements of this type. You can add or remove stars (dollars) from the left end of the row, as long as you keep the number of stars equal to $n$. Similarly, you can add or remove bars (dividers) from the right end of the row, as long as you keep the number of bars equal to $k-1$.\n\nThis creates a grid of possible arrangements, where each row corresponds to a particular value of $i$ between 0 and $n$, representing the number of stars (dollars) at the left end. Each column corresponds to a particular value of $j$ between 0 and $k-1$, representing the position of a bar.\n\nThe total number of arrangements is then given by:\n\n$$\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$$\n\nwhere $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$ represents the number of ways to choose $k-1$ positions out of $n+k-1$.\n\nThis formula can be proved using combinatorial reasoning, but I'll spare you the details for now.\n\nNow, let's look at your table.
