INFO: User: My first problem is related to the behavior of certain elementary particles as described in the modern physics, but it can be presented in much less forbidding language.
Suppose that I have some dollar bills, say n of them, and in a fit of generosity I decide to give them away to the k friends who happen to be with me at the moment. Of course, in purchasing power one bill is just like any other, but the friends are clearly distinguishable from one another. My question is, "In how many different ways can I carry out this charitable intent?". The answer is given in the following table for small values of n and k.
